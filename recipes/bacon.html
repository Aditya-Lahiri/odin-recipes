    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>In order to make bacon, it's a very simple process, anyone could do it. Start by going to the
        grocery store and bying strips of bacon. When you get back home, put the bacon in a skillet or
        pan and let it cook. You won't even need oil because the bacon will generate it's own
        grease from all the latent fat it has stored inside of it. Once the bacon looks crispy, use
        tongs to take it out and enjoy!
